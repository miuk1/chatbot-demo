            <h2>What are Chatbots?</h2>
            <p>Generally speaking a bot is any software that performs an automated task, however we are interested
                in
                the
                class of
                bots that live online in chat platforms or on social media called chatbots.
                <br>
                In this context there are many possible definitions and some confusion about what a bot is. This is
                partly
                because
                there are so many varied use cases for bots and these influence what people perceive a chatbot to
                be.
                <br>
                The most intuitive definition is that a bot is software that can have a conversation with a human.
                For
                example a user
                could ask the bot a question or give it an instruction and the bot could respond or perform an
                action
                as
                appropriate.</p>

            <h2>Why use ChatBots?</h2>
            <p>
                Chatbots have potential. Even though they are increasingly used, the modern chatbot is still a
                young
                technology. With
                the continuing development of AI, the potential for bots in business and personal lives is
                unlimited.
                <br>
                They can be easy to build. It depends on what you want to achieve, of course, but you can
                design a
                simple
                chatbot based on the Facebook Messenger without any programming experience.</il>
                <br>Chatbots emphasize the company’s brand and image. The chatbot represents the company when it’s
                communicating with the customer, so, from a marketing point of view, it is a perfect embodiment
                of
                brand building.
                <br>They offer straightforward services. A well-optimized chatbot communicates only the essentials
                and
                does
                not
                overwhelm the user.
                <br>Chatbots automate processes. Bots are able to take on human work for, generally speaking,
                mundane
                or
                basic
                analytic tasks.<br>

            <p>
                Chatbots work within chat platforms such a Facebook Messenger, Slack or SMS. Each chat platform has
                it’s
                own features.
                These features determine the possible ways in which the chatbot can interact with the user or the
                group
                or
                team,
                however the actual behaviour of the chatbot is determined by the bot itself.
                <br>
                For example, an sms bot can only show text and attach multi-media widgets in some cases. An email
                bot
                has
                the same
                limitations. A Facebook Messenger or Telegram Bot can interact with the user using a variety of
                graphical
                widgets. A
                Facebook Messenger, Kik or Telegram bot can also give the user access to webviews, i.e. essentially
                allowing unlimited
                flexibility in terms of the user interface that can be offered to the user.

            <h2>How can you create Chatbots?</h2>
            <p><strong>Code Everything Yourself</strong> - Use open source libraries like Apache Open NLP or
                Stanford
                Open
                NLP to create your own Flow
                and NLU.</p>
            <p><strong> NLP platforms to do the Intent and Entity extraction</strong> - This takes over the load of
                understanding Machine Learning,
                but you still need to code your own Flow</p>
            <p><strong>Use DIY (Do It Yourself) platforms for building a bot</strong> - There are some platforms
                like
                which
                provide you with Drag ‘n’
                Drop features to build chat bots in very less time and without any coding. There are different
                types of
                platforms:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. ChatterOn</li>
